When the Xbox 360 launched in 2005, it was a cutting edge. The Xbox One is the eighth generation of the Xbox.
It offers better graphics, faster processing, more storage and more advanced controllers. The Xbox One is boxier and 
slightly larger than its predecessor. This larger size is also said to cut down on overheating, an issue the 360 has 
sometimes faced. While Microsoft almost completely overhauled the Xbox in its creation of the Xbox One, the Xbox 360 
still holds the title for best-selling game console in history.
