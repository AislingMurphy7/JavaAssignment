When the Xbox 360 launched in 2005, it was a cutting edge, seventh generation console that combined crisp graphics with 
motion-sensing technology. The Xbox One, which launched in late 2013, is the latest and eighth generation of the Xbox 
console family. It offers better graphics, faster processing, more storage, and more advanced controllers than the Xbox 
360. The two console generations differ on the outside, too. Sharing some design features with the latest Microsoft phones
and tablets, the Xbox One is boxier and slightly larger than its predecessor. This larger size is also said to cut down 
on overheating, an issue the 360 has sometimes faced. While Microsoft almost completely overhauled the Xbox in its 
creation of the Xbox One, the Xbox 360 still holds the title for best-selling game console in history.
