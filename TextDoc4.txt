Most breeds of dog are a few hundred years old. The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more 
behavioral variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured between the Chihuahua and the Irish 
Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark 
("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, 
curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat. While all dogs are genetically very similar,
natural selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving 
rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics. Dog 
breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals 
within the same species. Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds.
