Apple got a lot of flak last year after its new smartphones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were found to bend relatively
easily. Several users including many YouTubers had reported that the iPhone models, most especially the larger iPhone 6 
Plus, were bending after normal use. The controversy, called 'bendgate', resulted in Apple even defending its testing 
processes, and reportedly made changes to fix the issue for later units in the line. With the use of series 7000 
aluminium, Apple says 2015's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are much stronger, and the company certainly appears to have 
learnt from past mistakes, as a new bend test shows the new iPhone models are too strong to bend easily.
