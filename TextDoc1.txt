Apple got a lot of flak last year after its new smartphones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were found to bend relatively
easily. Several users including many YouTubers had reported that the iPhone models, most especially the larger iPhone 6 
Plus, were bending after normal use. With the use of series 7000 aluminium, Apple says 2015's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s 
Plus are much stronger as a new bend test shows the new iPhone models are too strong to bend easily.
